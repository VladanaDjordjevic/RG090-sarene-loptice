# What is the point of the game? Short description.

The goal is for yellow cubes to be collected and purple cones to be avoided by the sphere. Initially, the sphere is green. To notify the player, the sphere changes color to yellow (if sphere is on the same track as cube) or purple (if sphere is on the same track as cone). Cones and cubes are always on different tracks. The speed of cones and cubes increases over time. To make game harder for player different rotations are activated.

When player loses the game, a new scene appears with a sign "YOU LOST". Also, the number of won points is shown, as well as the rating in stars.
